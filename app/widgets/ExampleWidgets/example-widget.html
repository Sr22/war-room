  Hi there, <b>here is some arbitrary code</b>. You can <i>edit</i> me in order to make a <code>widget</code>.
  In fact, you can even include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">JavaScript</a>:
  <button onclick="alert('You clicked on me!');">Click me!</button>.
